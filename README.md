The following repository is to undertand the use of tensorflow in predicting a time series data , Here we are creating a synthetic data which has a trend and a seasonality and futher we will forcast the data that is will predict with a 3 layered neural network model .
It includes creating data with tensorflow data set api and using traditional ml,dl methods on it .
We will also plot how it originally looks and then we will divide into train and test set .
After traininig we will predict on the test set , and then we will plot to see how the model has is working and at the end we will check the matric of it .
